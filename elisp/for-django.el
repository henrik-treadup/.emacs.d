;;; Customizations for Django
;;;

;; There seems to be three packages that are useful for Django development.

;; pony-mode
;; https://github.com/davidmiller/pony-mode

;; django-mode
;; https://github.com/myfreeweb/django-mode

;; python-django
;; https://github.com/fgallina/python-django.el


;; For web mode you should be able to set the engine family to Django.

;; Spacemacs uses Pony mode for its Django layer.
