;;; Customizations for modeline
;;;

;; Currently I am using spaceline for the modeline. This is configured in the setup-theme.el file.
;; Right now it does everything I want the modeline to do. For example it displays the current
;; python virutal environment name in the modeline.

;; Do not write a custom mode line. It seems insanely time consuming to get anything good working.
