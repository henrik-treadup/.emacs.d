# Navigation
Navigating in Emacs

You can navigate backwards and forwards over characters, words, sexps,
sentences and paragraphs.

M-b is backward word.
M-f is forward word.

## Smartscan
M-p will jump backward to the previous symbol at point

M-n will jump forward to the next symbol at point.

## Searching
C-s will search forward.
C-r will search in reverse.
C-M-s will run swiper-helm.

If you need to navigate a few lines backwards or forwards then you can
use C-s or C-r to search for something close to where you want to be.

In other words use searching with C-s and C-r as part of navigation.

## Better key bindings
From Effective Emacs
Effortless navigation: re-bind a few keys so that you can move the
cursor in any direction, by chars or words, by holding down Alt and
just pressing various letter keys.
