# Windows
There are a bunch of different ways to manage windows.

## Basics

C-x 0 is mapped to kill-window.

C-x 1 is mapped to kill-other-windows.

C-x 2 is mapped to split-window-vertically.

C-x 3 is mapped to split-window-horizontally.

C-x 7 will toggle the *scratch* buffer.

C-x 9 is mapped to split-T which will split the current window
vertically and then split the other window horizontally.

C-x + is mapped to balance windows.

Navigating to the other window is mapped to the C-x o key chord or M-o
key chord.
